      "A Funkyprompt agent is a type of AI agent designed to handle complex tasks by leveraging a dynamic and modular approach to function execution and state management. Here are the key principles and features of a Funkyprompt agent:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Dynamic Function Execution**: Funkyprompt agents can call various functions to answer user questions or perform tasks. These functions are loaded on demand and can be searched and managed dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **State Management**: The agent outsources stateful jobs to manage the message stack (a list of messages) and the function stack. This allows the agent to maintain context and handle multi-step workflows effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Object-Oriented Generation Paradigm**: Agents are treated as objects that contain methods, fields, and metadata. This encapsulation allows for rich semantics and access to functions within a single object.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Declarative Approach**: The agent's behavior, goals, and functions are defined declaratively within the object. This makes it easier to understand and manage the agent's capabilities and responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Response Schema**: Agents can provide a response schema to guide the format of their responses, ensuring consistency and clarity in communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Multimodal Applications**: Funkyprompt agents can handle multimodal tasks, such as image description, by calling appropriate functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Lightweight and Intuitive**: The framework is designed to be lightweight, with the runner being a simple shell of fewer than 200 lines of code. This simplicity makes it easy to build and extend complex agent systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, a Funkyprompt agent is a versatile and modular AI agent that can dynamically manage functions and state to handle a wide range of tasks efficiently."
